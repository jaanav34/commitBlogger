## Todo List

### Phase 1: Refine Ingestion Module (ingest.py)
- [x] Implement pagination for GitHub commits in batch mode.
- [x] Implement Notion API integration to fetch notes.
- [x] Add robust error handling and retry mechanism for GitHub API calls.

### Phase 2: Refine Transformation Module (transform.py)
- [x] Implement more sophisticated diff summarization, potentially using Gemini for large diffs.
- [x] Add error handling for Gemini content filtering or empty responses.
- [x] Ensure all content generation functions are robust.

### Phase 3: Refine Publisher Module (publisher.py)
- [x] Implement robust error handling and retry mechanism for WordPress XML-RPC calls.
- [x] Add more MIME types for media uploads.

### Phase 4: Refine Exporter Module (exporter.py)
- [x] Implement a more robust way to check if the Simply Static export is complete (e.g., polling a status endpoint or checking file modification times).

### Phase 5: Refine Deployer Module (deployer.py)
- [x] Consider a safer push strategy for Git if history preservation is critical (though force push is common for gh-pages).

### Phase 6: Refine Main Orchestration Script (main.py)
- [x] Implement Notion ingestion integration.
- [x] Implement retry logic for individual commit processing failures.
- [x] Implement saving LinkedIn summary to a file or database.
- [x] Ensure all environment variables are loaded and validated correctly.

### Phase 7: Enhance Error Handling and Logging
- [x] Implement `tenacity` for retry logic with exponential backoff.
- [x] Set up comprehensive logging across all modules.

### Phase 8: Update Documentation and Testing Plan
- [x] Update `configuration_guide.md` with any new configurations.
- [x] Update `scheduling_error_handling.md` with any new error handling details.
- [x] Refine `test_modules.py` with more comprehensive unit and integration tests.

### Phase 9: Deliver Final Solution
- [ ] Compile all updated files and documentation.
- [ ] Present the complete solution to the user.
