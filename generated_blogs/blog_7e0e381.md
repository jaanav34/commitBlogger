Hey everyone, Jaanav Shah here, a Computer Engineering student at Purdue! In my last update, I shared the initial vision for an AI Teleprompter â€“ a discrete, always-on-top overlay designed to minimize context switching and keep you in that precious state of "flow" by providing instant answers to your questions. It was all about bringing real-time, on-demand knowledge right to your fingertips.

But what if we could push this concept even further? What if our AI co-pilot could not just *answer* questions instantly, but also *proactively generate, organize, and format* comprehensive knowledge documents, transforming raw information into polished, academic-grade resources?

This latest series of updates represents a significant evolution, shifting our focus from solely "instant answers" to **automated, structured knowledge production.** Think of it as moving from quick, conversational snippets to building entire, meticulously organized study guides and formal documents, all powered by AI.

### Beyond Instant Answers: Crafting Comprehensive Knowledge

As students, we're constantly bombarded with information. Turning lecture notes, research papers, and scattered facts into a coherent, exam-ready study guide or a well-structured report can be incredibly time-consuming. The initial AI teleprompter excelled at solving immediate informational gaps. Now, we're tackling the next big challenge: automating the *creation* of high-quality, formatted learning materials.

My goal was clear: to leverage the AI's ability to synthesize information, not just for quick lookups, but for building robust, reusable study aids and professional documents. This update introduces a powerful new workflow that orchestrates AI-driven content generation, structured assembly, and sophisticated formatting, taking the heavy lifting out of knowledge compilation.

Let's dive into how we're making this new chapter a reality.

### The Engine of Automated Knowledge: A Three-Pronged Approach

This new functionality is built upon significant enhancements to our existing components and the introduction of entirely new, specialized scripts.

#### 1. `notebook_automator.py`: From Raw Text to Structured Markdown

The `notebook_automator.py` script, which previously scraped raw text responses from Google NotebookLM, has undergone a crucial transformation. Its role now extends beyond just retrieving answers; it's responsible for *structuring* them for downstream processing.

*   **HTML to Markdown Conversion:** The AI's responses in NotebookLM are rendered as HTML. We've integrated the `html2text` library to convert this raw HTML content directly into **Markdown**. Markdown is key because it provides a semantically rich, easy-to-parse structure that makes the AI's output far more usable for automated systems.
*   **Intelligent Markdown Cleaning:** Raw AI output, even in Markdown, often contains artifacts like UI elements, extraneous numbers, or citation markers (e.g., `[1]`, `[2,3]`). We've implemented a suite of regular expression-based cleaning operations to meticulously remove these distractions, standardize ellipsis usage, and refine Unicode characters. This ensures the Markdown is clean, concise, and ready for further processing.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Crucially, the cleaned Markdown response is now automatically saved to a file named `response.md`. This seemingly small change is foundational, enabling other parts of our system to access and build upon the AI's generated content programmatically, rather than just displaying it.
*   **Enhanced Reliability:** The `page.wait_for_timeout` for AI responses has been increased to 15 seconds, providing more robustness for longer or more complex queries, especially after the Markdown conversion.

This evolution of `notebook_automator.py` makes it the indispensable first step in our new automated content pipeline, ensuring the AI's output is not just accurate, but also *structured and reusable*.

#### 2. `study_guide_generator.py`: Assembling the Academic Blueprint

With the `notebook_automator` now producing clean, structured Markdown, we can tackle the challenge of generating an entire study guide. This is where the new `study_guide_generator.py` comes into play.

*   **Topic-Driven Generation:** This script isn't just randomly querying the AI. It starts by parsing a `topics.md` file, which defines the major sections and subsections of our desired study guide (e.g., for "ECE 270 Exam 2"). This allows us to guide the AI's focus precisely.
*   **Prompt Engineering for Coherence:** For each topic, the script constructs a highly specific prompt using a `PROMPT_TEMPLATE`. This prompt guides the AI (via `query_notebook`) to fetch relevant information, focusing on exam-relevant content and problem-solving techniques.
*   **Section-by-Section Assembly:** As each section's content is generated and cleaned by `notebook_automator`, `study_guide_generator.py` appends it to a `final_study_guide.md` file. Each section is clearly delineated with appropriate Markdown headers, creating a logical flow for the entire document.
*   **Robust Workflow:** By leveraging `asyncio`, the script efficiently manages multiple AI queries, ensuring that even lengthy study guides can be generated without blocking the process. Basic error handling is also included to ensure the process stops gracefully if an issue with the AI query occurs.

This new script automates the tedious process of compiling and organizing information, turning a list of topics into a fully formed, structured study guide in Markdown.

#### 3. `md_to_latex_converter.py`: Polishing for Professionalism

Having a structured Markdown study guide is great, but for academic submissions or truly professional presentation, LaTeX is often the gold standard. This is the role of our third new component: `md_to_latex_converter.py`.

*   **Gemini API Integration for Sophisticated Conversion:** Instead of relying on simplistic Markdown-to-LaTeX tools, we've integrated the **Google Gemini API** (`gemini-2.0-flash`). This allows us to instruct a powerful large language model to perform the conversion. The `LatexConverter` class prompts the Gemini API with detailed instructions to ensure content fidelity, proper Unicode handling, and aesthetic formatting, while explicitly telling Gemini to *avoid* conversational filler.
*   **Comprehensive LaTeX Structure:** The script includes a robust `LATEX_HEADER`, pre-configured with essential packages for math (`amsmath`, `amssymb`), tables (`tabularx`), code listings (`listings`), graphics (`graphicx`), and precise geometry. This ensures the output is not just syntactically correct LaTeX, but also a beautifully formatted, print-ready document.
*   **Resilient Retries:** API calls can be flaky. Our `_make_llm_call_with_retries` method incorporates exponential backoff, making the conversion process robust against temporary network issues or API rate limits. Streaming is also enabled for handling potentially large outputs efficiently.
*   **Pre-conversion Markdown Cleaning:** A `clean_markdown_for_conversion` function further pre-processes the input Markdown, removing any remaining conversational phrases that might confuse the LLM during conversion, ensuring the cleanest possible input for Gemini.

This final step transforms the AI-generated Markdown into a professionally typeset LaTeX document, suitable for formal study, presentations, or submission, completing the journey from raw query to polished academic output.

### `teleprompter_ui.py`: Refining the Interactive Experience

While the core focus of this update is on automated content generation, we haven't forgotten the interactive teleprompter. The `teleprompter_ui.py` received crucial updates to enhance its cross-platform robustness and user experience:

*   **Platform-Specific Hotkey Management:** To ensure optimal performance and avoid conflicts, `pynput` (our global hotkey library) is now conditionally imported and initialized only on Windows.
*   **Linux/macOS UI Enhancements:** For non-Windows users, the Tkinter window is now set to `'utility'` type for better focus behavior. A comprehensive set of in-app hotkeys is directly bound to the `TeleprompterApp` instance, providing seamless keyboard shortcuts when the window is focused. A `force_focus` method ensures the input field consistently receives focus on Linux.
*   **Windows Invisibility Boost:** On Windows, `ctypes` is now used to apply the `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` style, significantly improving the teleprompter's ability to remain invisible to screen recorders, reinforcing its discrete nature.
*   **Cleanup and Refinements:** Redundant code, unused imports (`psutil`), and duplicate function calls were removed, contributing to a cleaner, more efficient codebase.

These refinements ensure that the interactive AI teleprompter remains a reliable, user-friendly tool across different operating systems, continually improving its core promise of seamless, distraction-free knowledge access.

### The Impact: Your Knowledge Production Powerhouse

These updates represent a significant leap in the project's capabilities. We're moving beyond simple real-time querying to:

*   **Automate Study Guide Creation:** Turn a list of topics into a fully structured, AI-generated study guide.
*   **Produce High-Quality Documents:** Convert AI-generated Markdown into professionally formatted LaTeX, ready for academic or professional use.
*   **Enhance AI Output Usability:** The `notebook_automator` now provides consistently clean, structured Markdown, making the AI's output far more versatile.
*   **Improved Cross-Platform Experience:** The interactive teleprompter is now more robust and user-friendly on various operating systems.

This means less time spent manually compiling notes, formatting documents, or sifting through information, and more time for actual learning and creation. This is about empowering students and professionals to leverage AI for truly *productive* knowledge management.

### What's Next?

The journey continues! My immediate thoughts for future development include:

*   Exploring integration with other knowledge bases (e.g., local PDFs, web content) for study guide generation.
*   Adding more advanced formatting and customization options for LaTeX output.
*   Developing a more intuitive topic management interface for the study guide generator.
*   Continuing to refine the interactive UI based on user feedback.

I'm incredibly excited about the potential of this project to fundamentally change how we interact with and produce knowledge. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build out this powerful AI co-pilot!
