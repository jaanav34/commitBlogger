# Scheduling and Error Handling Strategies

This section outlines how to schedule the Automated Blog Generator pipeline for regular execution and strategies to handle potential errors and retries.

## 1. Scheduling Instructions

The pipeline is designed to run periodically, ideally daily, to ingest new commits and notes, generate content, and publish updates. You can schedule the main script (`main.py` - to be created later) using `cron` on Linux/macOS or Task Scheduler on Windows.

### A. Linux/macOS (Cron)

Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. You can edit your crontab to add a new entry.

1.  **Open your crontab:**
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

2.  **Add the following line** to schedule the script to run daily at, for example, 3:00 AM. Ensure the path to your Python executable and script are correct.
    ```cron
    0 3 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/project/main.py --mode incremental >> /path/to/your/project/cron.log 2>&1
    ```

    *   `0 3 * * *`: This cron expression means 


the job will run at 0 minutes past 3 AM every day.
    *   `/usr/bin/python3`: Replace with the actual path to your Python 3 interpreter.
    *   `/path/to/your/project/main.py`: Replace with the absolute path to your `main.py` script.
    *   `--mode incremental`: This argument will tell `main.py` to run in incremental mode, processing only new commits.
    *   `>> /path/to/your/project/cron.log 2>&1`: Redirects all output (stdout and stderr) to a log file for debugging.

### B. Windows (Task Scheduler)

Windows Task Scheduler allows you to automate tasks. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1.  **Open Task Scheduler:** Search for "Task Scheduler" in the Start menu.
2.  **Create Basic Task:** In the Actions pane, click "Create Basic Task...".
3.  **Name and Description:** Give your task a meaningful name (e.g., "Automated Blog Generator Daily Run") and a description.
4.  **Trigger:** Select "Daily" and set the desired time (e.g., 3:00 AM).
5.  **Action:** Select "Start a program".
    *   **Program/script:** Enter the full path to your Python executable (e.g., `C:\Python39\python.exe`).
    *   **Add arguments (optional):** Enter the full path to your `main.py` script followed by the incremental mode argument (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\blog_generator\main.py --mode incremental`).
    *   **Start in (optional):** Enter the directory where your `main.py` script is located (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\blog_generator`).
6.  **Finish:** Review your settings and click "Finish".

## 2. Error-Handling & Retries

Robust error handling is crucial for an automated pipeline. The following strategies should be implemented:

### A. API Rate Limits

*   **Identify Rate Limits**: Be aware of the rate limits for GitHub, Gemini, Notion, and WordPress APIs. Consult their respective documentation.
*   **Exponential Backoff**: When a rate limit error (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests) is encountered, implement an exponential backoff strategy. This means waiting for a progressively longer period before retrying the request.
    *   Initial wait: 1 second
    *   Subsequent waits: 2 seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds, etc., up to a maximum (e.g., 60 seconds).
*   **Retry Decorators**: Use libraries like `tenacity` in Python to easily apply retry logic with exponential backoff to API calls.

### B. Network Failures

*   **Connection Errors**: Handle `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` for network connectivity issues.
*   **Timeouts**: Implement timeouts for all HTTP requests to prevent indefinite waiting. Catch `requests.exceptions.Timeout`.
*   **Retries**: Similar to rate limits, use exponential backoff for network-related errors. Limit the number of retries to prevent infinite loops.

### C. Invalid Responses

*   **JSON Parsing Errors**: Use `try-except` blocks when parsing JSON responses (e.g., `json.JSONDecodeError`). If a response is not valid JSON, it might indicate an API issue.
*   **API-Specific Errors**: Check for error codes or messages within the API responses themselves (e.g., Gemini might return a content filtering error, GitHub might return authentication errors).
*   **Data Validation**: Validate the structure and content of data received from APIs before processing. If data is malformed or missing critical fields, log the error and skip processing that specific item.

### D. Logging

*   **Comprehensive Logging**: Implement a robust logging system (e.g., Python's `logging` module) to record:
    *   Start and end of each module's execution.
    *   Successful API calls and data processing.
    *   Warnings (e.g., skipped commits due to previous processing).
    *   All errors, including full tracebacks.
*   **Log Levels**: Use different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to control verbosity.
*   **Log Rotation**: Configure log rotation to prevent log files from growing too large.

### E. Idempotency

*   **Processed State File**: The `processed_state.json` file ensures that commits are not processed multiple times, even if the script is rerun due to an error. This makes the pipeline idempotent for commit ingestion.
*   **WordPress Post ID**: When publishing to WordPress, if a post is created, store its ID. If the script needs to retry publishing the same content, it can attempt to update the existing post rather than creating a duplicate.

### F. Alerting (Future Enhancement)

*   For production-like environments, consider adding alerting mechanisms (e.g., email, Slack notification) for critical errors or repeated failures. This would require integrating with an external service.

By implementing these strategies, the Automated Blog Generator pipeline will be more resilient to transient issues and provide better insights into its operation.
