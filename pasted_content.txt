When running this prompt on chatgpt:
Based on your full memory of my background, projects, academic and professional experiences, habits, personal goals, and communication style — especially my work in computer engineering, data science, prompt engineering, and AI-driven tools — generate a list of 10 high-leverage, unconventional, and underutilized ways I could be using AI across personal productivity, skill development, creative projects, and professional growth.

For each suggestion:

1. Name the use case clearly.


2. Explain why it's relevant to my workflow, mindset, or context.


3. Detail how I could implement it, with specific examples, tools, or workflows.


4. Prioritize unexpected or creative uses I likely haven’t tried, especially ones that could offer compounding returns or strategic differentiation over time.



Consider both short-term efficiency gains and long-term asymmetric upside. Don't limit suggestions to mainstream AI usage; feel free to go deep into niche, experimental, or hybrid use cases — even across disciplines.

You can assume I'm technically skilled, a fast learner, and willing to experiment if the ROI is clear.




i got this result:

9. Automated Technical Blog & Portfolio Generator
Why it's relevant: You do impressive work, but unless it’s published, it’s invisible. Most engineers don’t write. If you automate it, you'll stand out immensely.

How to implement:

Build a bot that:

Converts GitHub commits, Notion notes, or code comments into markdown blog posts.

Uses GPT to rephrase them for:

Technical blog.

LinkedIn post.

HackerNews-worthy title.

Schedule weekly releases — even if short — to build public IP and proof-of-work.



NOW AI STUDIO HAS TO HELP ME IMPLEMENT THIS.



INSTRUCTIONS:
Awesome — here's the **revised, end-to-end plan** based on your updated goals:

---

## 🚀 **Automated Blog Generator (WordPress, Gemini, GitHub Pages Edition)**

You’ll be building a local, AI-assisted publishing pipeline that:

* Runs on **your own computer**
* Pulls from **GitHub commits + Notion notes**
* Uses **Google AI Studio’s Gemini API**
* Publishes to **WordPress.org (locally hosted)**
* Exports to static HTML via **Simply Static**
* Deploys to **GitHub Pages**
* Includes a **batch mode** to process all your historical commits

### ⚙️ 3. Local Setup Instructions

#### A. WordPress.org (Localhost)

* Install [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) or XAMPP to host WordPress on your machine.
* Set up your theme and install **Simply Static** plugin.
* Set permalink structure to `/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%/`.

#### B. Gemini API Access

* Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).
* Use Gemini via REST or `google.generativeai` for Python.

```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

---

### 🔄 4. Content Ingestion Script

```python
# scripts/ingest_commits.py
from github import Github
import datetime

def fetch_recent_commits(repo_name, since_days=7):
    g = Github("your_github_token")
    repo = g.get_repo(repo_name)
    since = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=since_days)
    commits = repo.get_commits(since=since)
    return [{
        'sha': c.sha,
        'message': c.commit.message,
        'diff': c.files,
        'date': c.commit.author.date
    } for c in commits]
```

---

### ✨ 5. Gemini Transformer

```python
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY")

def generate_blog_post(commit_message, code_diff):
    prompt = f"""You're a technical blogger.
    Based on the commit message: {commit_message}
    And code diff summary: {code_diff}
    
    Write a Markdown-formatted blog post (2–3 paragraphs) explaining:
    1. What was implemented or changed
    2. Why it matters or how it fits into a larger project
    3. Include technical clarity and readability
    """
    model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")
    response = model.generate_content(prompt)
    return response.text
```

---

### 📝 6. WordPress Post Uploader (Localhost XML-RPC)

Install plugin: `Enable Application Passwords` or use `WP REST API`.

```python
import requests
from wordpress_xmlrpc import Client, WordPressPost
from wordpress_xmlrpc.methods.posts import NewPost

client = Client('http://localhost/wordpress/xmlrpc.php', 'your-username', 'your-app-password')

def post_to_wordpress(title, content_md):
    post = WordPressPost()
    post.title = title
    post.content = content_md
    post.post_status = 'publish'
    client.call(NewPost(post))
```

---

### 📦 7. Simply Static Export + GitHub Pages

#### A. Configure Simply Static

* Destination: **Local folder**
* Run export manually or trigger via URL (with cron or script).

#### B. Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
cd /path/to/exported/html
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git checkout -b gh-pages
git add .
git commit -m "Update blog"
git push origin gh-pages --force
```

Automate this with a `deploy.sh` script + scheduled task.

---

### ⏮️ 8. Batch Mode for Historical Commits

```python
def batch_process_commits(repo_name, num_commits=100):
    g = Github("token")
    repo = g.get_repo(repo_name)
    commits = repo.get_commits()
    for c in commits[:num_commits]:
        # run same flow as above
        message = c.commit.message
        files = [f.filename for f in c.files]
        content = generate_blog_post(message, files)
        post_to_wordpress(c.sha[:8], content)
```

This retroactively converts your **project history into proof of expertise**.

---

### ⏲️ 9. Schedule the Whole Pipeline

* On **Linux/Mac**: Use `cron`
* On **Windows**: Use Task Scheduler
* Run a master script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
python scripts/ingest_commits.py
python scripts/transform_commits.py
python scripts/post_to_wordpress.py
# Optionally: trigger simplystatic URL to regenerate site
```

---

### ✅ Optional Enhancements (Future)

* Add a **Notion mode** to process tagged notes into draft posts.
* Create a simple CLI:

  ```bash
  $ blogbot publish --since 3d
  $ blogbot batch --limit 50
  ```
* Add a **TUI dashboard** to review and edit content before publishing.
* Auto-generate **SEO metadata**, slugs, and tags.



THINGS DONE ALREADY:
Installed LocalWP, installed SimplyStatic, got a Gemini API key.
